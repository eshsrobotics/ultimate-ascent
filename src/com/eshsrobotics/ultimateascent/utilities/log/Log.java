/**
 * Inspired by android.util.Log.
 *
 * API for sending log output.
 *
 * <p>You should generally use the Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.w(), and Log.w()
 * methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>In order of terms of verbosity from at least to most is ERROR, WARN, INFO,
 * DEBUG, VERBOSE. Verbose should never be compiled except during development.
 * Debug logs are compiled in, but stripped at runtime. Error, warning, and info
 * log are always kept.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Tip:</b></p> A good convention is to declare a <code>TAG</code> constant
 * in your class:
 *
 * <pre>private static final String TAG = "Climber";</pre>
 *
 * and use that in subsequent calls to the log methods.</p>
